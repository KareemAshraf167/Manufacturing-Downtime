# Manufacturing-Downtime
Manufacturing Downtime Analysis: Identifying Bottlenecks &amp; Efficiency Gaps

Overview:
This project analyzes manufacturing downtime to identify bottlenecks, inefficiencies, and their causes. By leveraging SQL, Python, and Power BI, the goal is to provide data-driven insights to improve operational efficiency.

Data Used:
A dataset containing production line activity, machine failures, shift details, and downtime reasons.
Includes timestamps, machine IDs, failure types, and resolution times.

Tools & Techniques:
SQL: Data extraction, transformation, and preprocessing.
Python (pandas, Matplotlib): Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & visualizations.
Power BI: Interactive dashboards for trend analysis and insights.

 Key Findings:
Identified top reasons for downtime and their impact on production.
Analyzed time-based trends to spot peak downtime periods.
Provided recommendations to reduce unplanned downtime and improve efficiency.
